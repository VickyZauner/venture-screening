The company\\'s mission is to use medical science and mobile technology to improve balance and prevent falls. The Nymbl System leverages validated studies, plus its Chief Scientist Dr. JP Farcy’s 35 years of clinical experience to provide a mobile-based balance improvement solution.  Nymbl consists of (1) a comprehensive balance evaluation and (2) a balance improvement program designed to be delivered on the smartphone or in a class.  The Balance Evaluation is a 3-part test administered on a smartphone or tablet that guides the user through the required exercises in approximately 5 minutes.  These tests measure stability, strength, and movement, and conform to the CDC STEADI protocol for balance measurement. The user is provided with a numerical balance score (1-100), an age group percentile, and the score is divided into its component parts. If a user is at risk for falls in any of the three categories, this is displayed.  The Balance Training app is a self-guided or coach-led intervention that prescribes appropriate exercises based on the balance score and provides simultaneous cognitive challenges. This “dual tasking” approach stimulates brain plasticity and mimics real-world settings where a user may fall because they become distracted. The exercises parallel the Otago recommendation, which demonstrated a 35% reduction in falls, plus exercises recommended by the Harvard Medical School.   The app animates and times the exercises for the user either in-home or in a class setting. The cognitive challenges, which are made up of trivia, math, pattern matching, memory problems, etc. engage the user, and the participants are often seen laughing while they perform their tandem stands, lunges, and wall sit. While the primary purpose of the cognitive challenges is to improve brain plasticity, they also make the training fun and increase user engagement. We have implemented our program in senior living communities with compelling results – community members who have gone through the program have increased their balance scores over 30% on average in 30 days, and in one community 50% of the residents who were at fall risk (based on the CDC measure) were no longer at risk! Nymbl won the 2017 Prime Health Competition, as the most promising health tech startup in Colorado. We received offers from Kaiser Permanente, University of Colorado Health, Centura, and SCL Health for pilot programs, all of which are proceeding. We have signed an Innovation Partnership with UCHealth. These key healthcare organizations are looking to reduce falls both in-patient and out-patient, and also use our measure of balance as a \"vital sign\" to improve population outcomes.', 'Procyrion develops technology solutions and offers a catheter-based circulatory support technologies.

It is currently developing solutions for the indication Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). The fungus Pneumocystis commonly resides in the lungs of healthy individuals, but the infection PCP does not arise until a person’s immune system is depressed at which time the Pneumocystis pathogens can replicate and cause an infection. PCP is the most common opportunistic infection in HIV/AIDS patients. It also affects other immunocompromised patients including those less than two years of age and over seventy years of age and those undergoing cancer treatment, immunosuppression for organ transplant surgery, corticosteroid treatment, or other immunosuppressive therapy.After infection occurs, PCP has a high mortality rate. MiniVax’s lead product candidate is a monoclonal antibody (PCP-Antibody) for the treatment of PCP. For those patients already suffering from PCP that are plagued by an average mortality rate of 20%, PCP-Antibody will provide an immediate defense against PC by delivering the antibodies needed to fight off the infection and thereby reducing the risk of mortality. A follow on product is a novel vaccine (PCP-Vaccine) for the prevention of PCP. PCP-Vaccine promotes the development of long term anti-Pneumocystis antibodies in patients receiving the vaccine. The antibodies help immunocompromised patients prevent Pneumocystis infection and, therefore, prevent PCP development. Similar to childhood vaccinations, one multi-dose regimen of PCP-Vaccine will be needed to confer lifetime protection. In addition to the therapeutic antibody and vaccine, MiniVax is developing a diagnostic (PCP-Diagnostic) for the detection of a Pneumocystis infection. Currently, clinical diagnosis of PCP is limited to immunohistochemistry and examination of chest X-rays, which have limited sensitivity, specificity, and speed. It takes a highly experienced physician to diagnose PCP. PCP-Diagnostic will provide a quick and accurate means of diagnosing PCP, thus ensuring that the appropriate treatment is prescribed in a timely manner. The preliminary technology for MiniVax’s PCP products was developed by Dr. Jay Kolls and Dr. Mingquan Zheng at Louisiana State University Health and Science Center (LSUHSC). Drs.

EyeTel was started with the idea of using new imaging technologies to address the large, growing and addressable clinical problem of vision loss due to undetected and untreated diabetic retinopathy.  The key tenets of the EyeTel Philosophy were established in those early days and are the foundation of their company: - World class technology that has extensive clinical validation - Along with expert clinical support - For use in the primary care setting to provide better care conveniently for patients - In a cost effective and easy to use way EyeTel worked in collaboration with the scientists from the Wilmer Eye Institute to develop the DigiScope, a semi-automated fundus camera with telemedicine capabilities.  A patent covering the technology was granted and they filed a 510(k) for the DigiScope and received FDA clearance in 1999.  A validation study independent of Wilmer was conducted at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, MI under the direction of Rhett Schiffman, M.D.  The results of the study were published in Ophthalmic Surgery, Lasers and Imaging and demonstrated excellent agreement, sensitivity and specificity compared with the gold standard seven-field color stereo photography for identifying patients with any levels of diabetic retinopathy.  As they grew, they created the EyeTel Reading Center, a world-class telemedicine service providing expert analysis of patient images by highly trained \"readers\".  The Wilmer Eye Institute provides clinical and quality oversight for the EyeTel Reading Center.  They also established a manufacturing agreement with Topzone of Changsha, China to manufacture the DigiScope.  This arrangement allows EyeTel to produce the DigiScope at low cost and provides a scalable source of DigiScope production. After an extensive worldwide search, Eli Lilly a leader in diabetes research, chose EyeTel to collaborate on market development for identifying patients with diabetic retinopathy. By 2007, their development work, with the scientists and clinical experts from Wilmer and with their manufacturing and development partner in China, led to significant enhancements to the capabilities of the EyeTel Retinal Imaging System making it a robust tool to help the Optometric physician detect age-related macular degeneration, optic disc abnormalities such as glaucoma, as well as diabetic retinopathy.

The program is self-directed and does not require a traditional therapist. Users access the program from a personal computer 24/7. People who used a new on-line post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) program featuring Eye Movement Memory Processing (EMMP) reported, on average, a 43% reduction in PTSD symptoms and PTSD-like symptoms found in victims of traumatic events like combat, domestic violence, sexual abuse, urban violence, rape, and acts of nature. The patent-pending online program for PTSD symptoms and PTSD-like symptoms is offered by ClaytonStress.com, a web-based company founded to provide an online delivery platform for the relief of PTSD symptoms and related conditions.  The EMMP protocols were further refined by psychiatrist Thomas D. Geracioti, Jr., M.D., of the Cincinnati Veterans Administration Medical Center. EMMP is based on research showing that particular patterns of eye movement can be useful in relieving PTSD symptoms and other similar conditions. Comparative effectiveness studies have found that eye movement therapy was as effective as cognitive behavioral therapy in reducing PTSD symptoms.  Dr. Geracioti evaluated the ClaytonStress EMMP protocol with veterans diagnosed with PTSD. Before using the ClaytonStress.com program, the veterans rated their average distress levels at 7.44, on a scale of 1 (minimal stress) to 10 (maximum stress). After the program, the veterans reported average distress levels of 2.87. While the ClaytonStress.com program was in beta testing more than 1,500 individuals used it on-line. This group self-reported an average 43% reduction in their distress levels after a single on-line session. The group included active military, veterans, and non-military civilians.

These molecules are designed to engage a well-known cellular receptor (PPAPγ) which has been validated as a drug target for treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus [T2DM] and inflammation.  Uniquely, Renew’s scaffold molecules also pass the blood brain barrier, together making this family of molecules particularly useful for indications of neuro-therapeutics. Accordingly, Renew is specifically focused on developing therapeutics to treat neuroinflammation pathologies (e.g. Traumatic Brain Injury [TBI]), with potential applications for other neuroinflammatory diseases.  No drug treatment is currently approved for TBI by the FDA, while millions of patients from all age groups are effected worldwide annually. While Renew’s molecules are uniquely suited for neurotherapeutics, Renew also seeks experienced partners to pursue opportunities related to Type 2 diabetes Mellitus [T2DM], where new partial agonists of PPARγ are thought to present an important path towards pharmaceutical treatment of this widespread modern disease. Renew’s proprietary “enzymatic chemistry” processes are in stark contrast to traditional “medicinal chemistry” processes commonly employed by big pharma.  While traditional pharmacology often requires noxious reaction components and exhibits low efficiencies, Renew’s custom engineered “enzymatic reactions” are highly specific and scalable.  These enzymatic reactions are particularly amenable for alkylresorcinol scaffold derivative molecules (that require prenylation-type synthesis).  Renew’s platform of engineered enzymes creates molecules that cannot otherwise be produced easily by synthetic means or from other natural sources. Importantly, Renew’s platform for creating therapeutic derivatives by custom engineered enzymes is covered by a robust IP portfolio, which includes recent patent applications and provisionals related to key enzymes (and engineered variants thereof) for production of alkylresorcinol derivatives by prenylation processes.', 'Relentless Pursuit Partners is an early stage fund dedicated to investing in preventative and proactive technology solutions that optimize health, activity and longevity.', 'BioControl Medical, a privately held medical device company headquartered in Yehud, Israel, with offices in New Hope, Minnesota, develops implantable medical devices to treat disorders of the autonomic nervous system. their objective is to improve quality of life and longevity of patients suffering from heart failure.

What makes trackle relevant right now?  With increasing age, the likelihood of getting pregnant lowers rapidly. Women who want to have kids lately need to know exactly about their fertility window in order to increase chances of getting pregnant.   Same applies for women who want to avoid pregnancy without hormone treatments. For them, it is important to know when their ovulation happens in order to choose the right means for contraception.  Knowing the individual fertility window becomes more and more relevant to a growing group of women.  What is the problem trackle is solving?  Identifying that rise of the body core temperature is challenging – especially as you need to avoid all noise that influences body core temperature. That is why women measure core temperature first thing in the morning before having moved. Thus, they operate with approximate values they enter into old fashioned scale paper graphs. How does trackle work? The wearable sensor is worn vaginal overnight and determines the core temperature every hour. It regularly transmits the values via a wireless connection to a gateway, which passes it on to a server. On the server it is processed and provided for the user’s mobile app.  Thus, the one and only relevant value can be identified easily: it is the lowest value measured overnight. In comparison to the other values taken the nights before, ovulation can be identified very securely and with our mature machine learning system, we are able to predict the exact timing of ovulation closer the more data we receive. The gateway serves as a safe and discrete storage box for the sensor also.', 'In this day and age of large data and the analyzed human, Vayu Technology brings a revolutionary device to the market.

With a focus on innovation, comfort, and rehabilitation, Allure works closely with hospitals to enhance clinical services and reduce readmission rates. The Allure Group’s unique approach to community care provides one-of-a-kind services and spaces based on cultural needs.   Founded in 2011, The Allure Group began, as many companies do, as a solution to a problem. When caring for his elderly grandfather, CEO Joel Landau noticed deficiencies in New York City’s eldercare field: specifically, a lack in resources needed by residents to live happy, comfortable lives. Landau saw in these failing nursing homes not a dead end, but an opportunity for New York’s ailing and aging seniors. When Victory Memorial Hospital was on the brink of closure in 2010, Landau and his partners acquired the center and transformed it into Hamilton Park Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, which now enjoys a 98% occupancy rate. The success of the Victory acquisition led the budding company, which recruited the talented Melissa Powell to head operations, to acquire two more non-profit homes in 2011 and 2012. What was once the Ruby Weston Manor became the Linden Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation, and the Marcus Garvey Residential Rehab Pavilion became the Crown Heights Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation. Heavy investments in these facilities elevated their care and quality to a new level. The centers now enjoy a 100% and 98% occupancy rate respectively, and CMS Five Star ratings as of 2016.   Today, The Allure Group manages six centers across Manhattan and Brooklyn, NY, adding to its network the Bedford Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation, the Harlem Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation, and the King David Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation.

With programs like the Longevity Gardens for Chinese seniors, Salud Latina for Latino seniors, bilingual staff members, as well as specialty services for patients with dementia and Alzheimer's, we keep our residents comfortable and safe.   We adhere to a set of values that inform our every decision in Allure centers. These include respect for the dignity of both residents and colleagues, compassion for patients and one another, honesty in all forms of communication, and integrity in our behavior, actions, methods, and principles.   The Allure Group’s one-stop centers, which seek to eliminate the “revolving door” nature of many rehab facilities, are designed to support the growing needs of the aging Baby Boomer generation. By creating spaces that are attentive to the needs of residents when it comes to their health, comfort, culture, and quality of life, Allure’s interdisciplinary team cultivates an environment where patients can thrive. The entire team at Allure is committed to leveraging well-grounded healthcare operating experience and industry knowledge to develop solutions that lead to improved health care quality and access, while still being affordable for all.

The Redoxagens are designed to hack into redox-mediated mitochondrial signaling pathways to turn on cellular self-repair mechanisms. They differ from the regular drugs: instead of targeting a single xenobiotic mechanism, Redoxagens induce multitude of redox-mediated cellular self-repair signaling pathways in normal cells and cell death in cells with high reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels/severe oxidative stress (i.e. cancerous). ROS and mitochondrial substrates potentiate Redoxagens - making their action specific to redox sites of electron transport chain (ETC) inside mitochondria and plasma membrane redox system (PMRS) and cells with elevated ROS levels. Once they reach the redox process/ROS-rich environment Redoxagen API, Geroxane, is consumed producing ROS-burst after which redox activity returns to normal = no chronic toxicity. This results in a dual mode of action:  a) in normal cells where redox activity is confined to mitochondria, activation of  Redoxagens is triggered at PMRS or at ETC sites inside mitochondria and induces on redox-mediated mitochondrial and cellular self-repair signaling pathways b) in cancerous cells where energy production/redox activity is localized to the cytosol or in cells with severe oxidative stress where ROS concentration in cytosol is already high, activation of Redoxagens results in ROS burst in cytosol, which brings ROS concentration to toxic levels and triggers on cell death. Redoxagens have been tested in over 300 humans and over 8,000 horses against numerous diseases with profound success and without serious adverse events.

At the Institute, he has revolutionized expectations about aging. Dr. Chein was trained in Rehabilitation Medicine at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles County Medical Center. Reviewing his credentials beyond medical education, it is little wonder that Dr. Chein is considered to be one of the United States’ leading experts in longevity and anti-aging medicine. He expanded the scope of the practice of Rehabilitation Medicine by including the treatment of aging as a disease to be rehabilitated. He has pioneered bio-identical hormone therapies and holds three U.S. patents for medical inventions. Also, he was the first doctor in the United States to clinically use growth hormone on adults in private practice, and the first to support bio-identical hormone balancing as a way to combat aging. He successfully won the legal opinion from a Superior Court judge to declare that “biological age can be reversed” and that the practice of administering Human Growth Hormone in the State of California is a science. This landmark case prevents the California Medical Board from disciplining any other physician in the state from using Growth Hormone for anti-aging purposes. Dr. Chein has seen over 10,000 patients and over 200 physicians as patients/trainees at the Institute. Dr. Chein published his early experiences at the Institute in bio-identical hormone therapy in his 1997 book “Age Reversal.” He postulated at the time that hormones are the messengers to the telomerase, a RNA molecule that lengthens the telomere in our DNA. Scientific discoveries revealed at that time that the healthy duplication and replacement of cells is dependent on that part of the DNA that shortens over time, called the telomere. Optimal hormone levels in our bodies help the DNA to have healthy and youthful cell division. It was at this Institute that Dr. Chein invented the “high-frequency and low-dose” method of supplementing Growth Hormone. He collaborated with the then Professor and Chairman of the Department of Neurology at the Medical College of Wisconsin to publish the 1,000-human subjects study using Growth Hormones safely to reverse biological age of greater than 10-20 years, as reported by the late Dr. Daniel Rudman of the medical college, but without any of the side effects of Growth Hormone reported by Dr. Rudman. Their work was subsequently published by the peer-reviewed Journal of Advancement in Medicine in the Fall of 1999. From 1999 to 2009, it was from the patients at Palm Springs Life Extension Institute that Dr. Chein discovered hormone optimization can lead to the unclogging of coronary arteries and the reversal or cure of such a neurological disease as Multiple Sclerosis, the other two inventions that won U.S. patents. In 2009, the Nobel Prize in Medicine was award to three scientists who demonstrated that the telomere, the tail portion of our DNA that controls our life spans, was itself controlled by a protein molecule in the nucleus of our cells called telomerase. By this time, scientists across the world had also discovered that bio-identical hormones in our bodies are the messengers that activate the telomerase. All these findings provided evidence and support for Dr. Chein’s work. As a result of the Nobel Prize, several laboratories in the U.S. started to offer biological age testing based on the length of the telomere or the percentage of short telomeres present in our cells. By doing such a test on himself, Dr. Chein surprisingly discovered that his biological age was 27 years younger than his chronological age. By using the same test in checking the biological age of his patients at the Palm Springs Life Extension Institute, he discovered that many of his patients had similar findings. For example, a 57-year-old woman had a biological age of 29, and a 42-year-old man had a biological age of 23.8. This led the Palm Springs Life Extension Institute to offer a $15,000 reward to anyone in the world who can show a bigger difference than 27 years between his/her chronological age and biological age using the same type of test. Prior to this scientific discovery, the words “Life Extension” in “Palm Springs Life Extension Institute” could only be shown by reversal of biological age, and “life extension” was an extrapolation or a logical deduction from reversal of biological age because no one at the Institute, including Dr. Chein, had lived to prove that his or her life was “extended.” Now, with a scientifically documented biological age of 33.9 at a chronological age of 60.4, there is no doubt that such an individual, for example, can live another 46 years to the present United States life expectancy of about 80 (in which case it would be 106!). This information will likely change everything you think you know about old age. The fact that long and healthy lives were not expected in previous generations is no reason that you should not expect them now.

Although many people consider being fit purely physical, they are wrong.

Doesn't that make overweight the average then? Last month you were fat, now you're average - hey, let's get a pizza!â€\\x9d â€“ Jay Leno Although people find humor in the unhealthy lifestyles people often lead, poor nutrition, overeating , eating disorders, and stress have become a very big problem when  it comes to weight and health.  Obesity rates have been reaching epidemic proportions in the US.  Eight out of ten people over the age of 25 is overweight.     Because of this horrifying statistic, there have been more and more efforts to counteract the unhealthy life.   Many people have found a passion in taking pride in oneâ€™s health and getting and staying fit as difficult as it may be.  There have been magazines that have tried spreading the message to the public as well as reality/competition shows that would do the same.  And now with the boom of technology, it is time for this common goal to be seen on the web.  ExerShare was first launched in September 2009.

Speaking with other patients who have been satisfied with the surgeonâ€™s results can also provide useful information about the recovery period and their satisfaction with the care provided and ultimately the aesthetic outcome. Understanding the surgeonâ€™s philosophy and surgical technique must also be a preliminary step toward establishing trust and determining whether surgical goals are mutual. Accordingly, Dr. Lam has set forth the following goals for every patient encounter and surgical enterprise:    1. To provide the best aesthetic and/or functional outcome.    2. To achieve only a natural, non-operated appearing surgical result.    3. To tailor every surgical endeavor to the patientâ€™s anatomy and desires.    4. To achieve the fastest, least painful recovery possible.    5. To use the latest, most advanced, but proven techniques to arrive at these goals.    6.

Description: A very common skin condition, seborrheic dermatitis affects more than three million people every year. It causes itchy, red skin or rashes with white scales. If you have this condition, you’ll find it on your scalp, face, forehead, and on the folds of skin around your nose, eyes, ears and eyelids. When it appears on your body, you’ll see it on the folds of the skin — including under your arms, below your breasts and around your groin, buttocks and navel. Your skin is the largest organ in your body, but it’s open to many attacks from countless different sources. It’s no wonder that your skin is prone to bumps, cuts, bruises, blemishes and rashes. Red dots on the skin can mean almost anything. The most reliable means of figuring out what’s behind those blemishes, though, involves a visit to an experienced New York dermatologist for a definitive diagnosis. Bruises are one of the most common skin conditions in the world. Most everyone experiences bruising during their lifetimes, and you may see bruises quite regularly, from young childhood into old age. Bruises are visible signs of trauma to your skin. They are caused by blood trapped underneath your skin. If you’ve contracted a skin condition that seems like acne or small pimples, but doesn’t respond to the usual treatments, you may very well have keratosis pilaris. A visit to your New York City dermatology office can “clear things up” about the nature of your skin condition and how to treat it. Keratosis pilaris are rough bumps on your skin that some say look like the skin of a plucked chicken. The common wart is a tough, grainy bump that commonly shows up on your hands and fingers. It’s caused by a virus that’s highly contagious and passed around by touch. That’s why warts are seen so often on kids, young adults and others with undeveloped or weakened immune systems.

Despite the decline in the working-age population and the continuation of medical and social welfare, Japan's social policies are not even felt as a concrete and effective measure. In June 2014, the Pharmacist Act was revised for the so-called comedy dispensing / insurance pharmacy industry in “false and empty health care” and “society that still clings to past heritage and truth” . The revamp of the law turned 180 degrees to “diagnose patients rather than drugs” and “find roles in super-aging society in collaboration with doctors and communities”. “Scope” has expanded, and at the same time, it has become possible to provide active support for the self-care and self-medication of the public. Based on this amendment, the “Health Support Pharmacy System” started in October 2016 as a measure of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Currently, the vast majority of about 250,000 pharmacists are able to overcome the changing situation on their own. Specific measures are not clearly defined. In the near future of these pharmacists, it is expected that there will be an urgent need to revise medical fees, and it will be necessary to enter a new position in the regional comprehensive system or a chosen position for advanced pharmacy. With such social backgrounds surrounding the medical treatment and the chaotic situation in the comedy industry, along with like-minded medical workers and experts, especially with pharmacists who have foresight and achievement, HMCE was established to achieve the major goal of “eliminating concerns about next-generation quality of life through accurate medical cost reduction”.\", 'We love trees.

For example, if you are concerned about your current long-term care plan, or have yet to construct a plan, an elder law attorney can advise you on the various options. In addition to this, an attorney can also help lay out a plan to make sure your wishes are carried out if you become disabled or incapacitated later on, and helps you decide who will be in charge of your care if you are unable to care for yourself. When a person has to move into a nursing home, they are required to divest themselves of their assets in order to pay for their care. However, by placing their assets into an Irrevocable Trust, the assets can be protected from high nursing home bills. However, it’s important to remember that this type of transfer must be done at least five years before a person goes into a nursing home. For many people, the best choice for long-term care costs involves setting up a Pooled Income Trust. Open to people of any age, it allows them to become financially eligible for insurance programs such as Medicaid, while at the same time preserving their monthly income in a trust to cover living expenses and other needs. By taking advantage of this option, a person can obtain Medicaid home care services for their long-term care needs, while continuing to have the money available to support themselves while at home. A variety of people can greatly benefit from establishing a pooled income trust, including recipients of personal injury settlements, elderly people who are ill and living at home, younger people who have special needs, and people who are applying for or already receiving government benefits.

Published research concludes that these annual exams and basic labs are useless in preventing disease. Useless unless you suffer from chronic illness to begin with. For those that are healthy, without complaints and wish to maintain their health and wellness, this paradigm is of no value. Step into the 21st century proactive and predictive testing paradigm of medicine. These selective laboratory biomarkers are focused on what hurts most Americans. Cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes ravage the apparently healthy American population and commit them to the remainder of a life of suffering if not detected early. Cardiometabolic biomarkers are the collection of proven diagnostic laboratory tests which can predict risk of chronic illness allowing an individual to side-step those diseases. While not inevitable, if not recognized early and accounted for they can manifest. Lifestyle modifications, diet and exercise along with selected nutrients can change the course of your health, wellness and longevity. Zimetry is the industry leader in providing predictive testing and self-monitoring devices to identify and assess relative risk and your odds-ratio for disease.

Once registered, users can enter persons to be tracked, and locations for those persons (e.g., home, work, school addresses).  Cases can then be created for those persons that reflect illnesses that they\\'re experiencing.  Cases include information such as symptoms, treatments, diagnoses, and log entries.  All data is dated so that a progression of an illness can be tracked.  Data entry fields are color coded so that users can see what data will be presented to the general public as-entered vs. slightly modified for privacy (e.g., birth dates are converted to age in years for cases, locations are \"blurred\"), vs. not shared at all. Once a case is entered, the user can search the database for other cases near their locations that have a subset of the entered symptoms.  Results are presented in tabbed areas based on all locations together and individual locations, sorted by the number of matching symptoms, date, etc.. Cases can be selected from the results list and viewed in detail.  This detail excludes personally identifying information.  In fact, the database design prevents access to personal information from case data.  At the bottom of every case there is a case forum that allows anonymous conversations between registered users. The overall system goal is to allow people who may not know each other personally to share information about the illnesses that are going around, and how they are treating them, and whether the treatments are working.  The hope is that this will reduce anxiety about illnesses as well as reducing health care expenses for unnecessary trips to the doctor.

The population of the social and health care district is about 132 000.

Although seemingly similar to competitor marketing firms selling our type of products, Lexicon specializes in distributing healthcare supplemental benefit products as first-offer to the senior citizen market. Like similar competitor marketers, LSH salespeople (referred to as Consultants) are provided with daily preset appointments Tuesday through Friday (no cold-calling!), but the quality of the LSH preset appointment is of a much higher quality.  LSH initially trains its new consultants only to sell the highest-demand, easiest to sell, most simple senior healthcare product, called Medicare Supplement. After placing this business, LSH further trains its consultants to sell additional products to their existing clients, while still allowing all of their consultants to continue on daily preset appointments at their own discretion. In addition, LSH consultants after having sold only $50,000 of Medicare Supplement (usually a 2 month period for an entry-level consultant to accomplish this level of production) are allowed to make their own decisions as to what days and what locations they wish to have preset appointments and are also given the option to step into a management role immediately.  Further differing itself similar competitors, in as soon as 6 weeks, all LSH consultants\\' commissions are markedly increased from their entry-level commission, as strict/regimented management of LSH consultants post $50,000 Medicare Supplement production is eliminated, training meetings are now optional, training travel is no longer necessary, they are selling far more of their appointments (as the learning curve is over!) earning a higher revenue margin to Lexicon per appointment provided, etc... Bottom-line, a jump in their commission level can now be made because a larger spread of commission dollars are available. Thus, the Lexicon marketing arm, unlike others, shares this higher dollar margin back to the consultant in the form of a generous commission level increase versus retaining it for higher corporate gains. Lexicon wants to not only care for, train, and support each consultant individually, but they understand a key fundamental ingredient to retaining a consultant is to make him/her a fortune quicker in upfront commission income as well as with immediate monthly residual income!  The most exciting part of selling for LSH is that their supplemental products are not affected by the economy whatsoever. To the contrary, individual consultant average sales volume is continuing to rise even in the midst of a down economy. This is simply due to the rapidly increasing number of babyboom generation seniors entering the marketplace. They have Lexicon\\'s products on the forefront of their mind as they approach age 65 as they need a product to take over their healthcare costs where Medicare leaves behind... LSH sales are literally sky-rocketing!  This creates the opportunity for a LSH consultant to build a fortune of clients on the books paying them an increasingly \"stacking\" monthly residual income and the opportunity to expand their horizons into additional senior products (and underage supplement products) with the virtual immediate option of leaping into a management role and earning more income from subordinate new consultants whom they initially train and manage through their learning curve.

So once we reach the age of sixty, we have to make sure that we know how to discipline ourselves and choose every healthy practice which each Non-Medical Home Care in Pennsylvania would recommend:   Eat Whole Grains. Whole grains would provide our bodies with carbohydrates just enough to give us hype throughout the day. The carbohydrates that this type of food brings to our body have a mild impact on our blood sugar- so you get the energy you need but you won’t harm your blood sugar levels at the same time. If you are a fan of bread and pastries, instead of eating those made of white and enriched wheat flours, shift to those made of whole grains.   Keep your Brain Working. Our mind is connected to our body. If our brain does not function properly, our body won’t. This is mainly the reason why we have to keep our mind alert to energize our body. We should not stop learning and stimulate our minds even after retirement. Through this, our body would mirror how our brain feels and become energized.   Stop the Vices. Bad habits die hard, they say. But if we want to keep our bodies at the great shape, we have to quit all our unhealthy habits like smoking and excessive drinking of liquor. Smoking does not only destroy our lungs; when one smokes a lot, our brains are slowly damaged too. Meanwhile, alcohol impairs the brain’s functioning and results in poor energy levels. We should end the notion of senior citizens being least energetic. We should make our choice- choose the healthy path and make every day of our senior years, a day full of life and vitality.

Current diagnostics only measure a more generalized lean mass or body fat, neither of which true indicators of strength and health, especially in the body compositions of young children. Yet, there does not exist an accurate way to measure direct skeletal muscle mass in any capacity. Flexaya is the first-to-market in offering a commercially available diagnostic to directly measure muscle mass. Using unique features of muscle tissue and creatine biology, Flexaya provides a simple, affordable approach to measure muscle mass, one that can be repeated at home through a subscription-based service model, all without the need for access to specialized equipment. We have validated this measure against the gold standard (MRI) with greater than 98% accuracy rate in both adults and children (see Clark J Appl Physiol 1985). At our respective academic institutions, we have implemented in this measure in a large, $1.5m NIH-funded study of more than 1400 older men, as well as in a large study of more than 100 infants and children with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The extensions of Flexaya’s testing method are vast, as studies underway indicate that muscle mass is perhaps the most sensitive metric to track growth stunting due to malnutrition, a global epidemic affecting nearly one-in-four children worldwide. As skeletal muscle is the largest organ in the body for glucose disposal, our measure may also have applications in diabetic research.  Flexaya’s method may well evolve as the standard diagnostic in what is an increasing appetite for self-diagnostic health and fitness data by the mass-market adult consumer, as well as become the defacto test for pediatricians and neonatologists to determine the trajectory of growth of infants and children.', 'MD&MD (MD Recommended; Mom & Dad Approved) promotes proactive mobile device solutions for health outcomes to drive higher wellness efficiencies and lower insurance premiums.

Treatment for varicose veins reduces the unsightly appearance and the painful symptoms that sometimes accompany them. Varicose vein treatment prevents their return and keeps you healthy. Spider veins are called that because they often look like a red or blue spider web creeping across your skin. They’re similar to varicose veins, but differ mainly in size. Spider veins tend to occur closer to the surface of your skin as well, whereas varicose veins are deeper and look like twisted cords or bulging ropes that swell when engorged. Spider veins usually appear on your face or legs, but can develop anywhere on your body. They may appear in very small batches or take up large areas of skin. Your New York dermatologist can tell you if you have varicose or spider veins and how best to treat them. All symptoms and skin findings should always evaluated with a thorough consultation and physical examination for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan in order to exclude any underlying serious condition. Spider veins, called telangiectasia in the jargon of your medical skin doctor, are common, especially as you age. Heredity plays a big role in whether or not you’ll be among the more than 55 percent of women and 45 percent of men who have some level of spider veins — usually on the legs. If you stand for long periods of time, you’re at a greater risk of developing spider veins, which form as a result of pressure placed on the blood vessels. They also are caused by weakened veins that end up with a backup of blood in them, leading to their appearance under your skin.

Usually Multiple Sclerosis Treatment is seen among those who have crossed the age of thirty but this disease can also be seen in younger people and this disease has affected more than a million.  The central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord and the body will be unable to live or think if the central nervous system does not function. Multiple sclerosis affects the process by which signals are getting transmitted through the nerve synapses and consequently there is interference with the functioning of our sense organs and consequently there is problem in tasting, smelling, touching and feeling.  A membrane called myelin surrounds the nerves of the central nervous system and multiple sclerosis affects this membrane as it makes the central nervous system attack the myelin membrane by sending the white blood cells and antibodies against it. Bacterial and viral infections are fought by the antibodies and white blood cells but the central nervous system gets confused due to multiple sclerosis and it sends the antibodies to fight against myelin and this destroys the functionality of the nerves. With time, all the nerve signals are blocked by multiple sclerosis which has serious repercussions upon the senses. Unfortunately, no permanent cure is available for this disease although it has been revealed through some tests that some results can be obtained through some therapy methods but still a lot of research needs to be done in this area.
